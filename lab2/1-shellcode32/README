Lab2: shellcode32
==================

  This challenge helps you prepare shellcodes on x86 (32-bit) architecture,
  which is a basic step toward writing an advanced exploitation. Write a
  shellcode (asm!) that reads a flag from the flag file!
  
   ; build
   $ ./make.sh
  
   ; shellcode to launch
   $ objdump -m i386 -D -b binary shellcode.bin
  
   ; fire
   $ (cat shellcode.bin; echo; cat) | ./test_your_shellcode
   ...
   cat flag
   ^D (Ctl-D to exit)
  
   Unfortunately that is not your solution. Please write a payload
   (readflag.S) that directly reads the flag from the file,
  
   ; run your shellcode
   $ cat readflag.bin | ./target 
  
   NOTE: you can only use 'open', 'read', and, 'write' system call.
